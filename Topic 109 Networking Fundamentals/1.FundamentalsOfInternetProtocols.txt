IP ( Internet Protocol)
Method of uniquely identifying an Address(destination) for a specific system
Two primary versions:

IPv4 - stndard address structure of four octets containing numbers between 0-255 for each
       Ex: 192.168.72.211
IPv6 - intended as replacement fr IPv4 consists of 128bit hexadecimal number for addressing
       2DAF:FF40:DD45:4444:00DD:0988:11EA:98AB

TCP ( Transmission Control Protocol)
The method by which all transactions b/w IP addresses of any version are communicated.
Defines a system of transmissions and acknowledgement to verify traffic arrives and can be assembed in correct order.

UDP ( User Datagram Protocol)
Often considered 'complementary' to IP, but is a stateless connection.
No error checking or retransmission of packets takes place, even if the transmission of the packet failed.

ICMP(Internet Control Message Protocol)
Designed for netwokring devices to send error messages
It can perform queries around network serivce availability(eg : ping)
It is turnedoff due security vulnerabilities (ex : denial attacks)

IP Class Ranges
Five ranges are specified in RFC 1918
The  values in each determine the total number of hosts that are available in each class
Class A: 1 - 126 - this leaves 16,777,214 host addresses available
Class B: 128 - 191 - this leaves 65534 hosts available(3rd and 4th octets are available)
Class C: 192 - 223 - this leaves 254 hosts available(4th and final octet is available)
Class D: 224-239 - multicast and not used for host addresses
Class E: 240-254 - reserved for future use

Network Mask
Defines a logical network(called a subnet) that indicates the start and ending of a range of addresses

Ranges
Each Class Range has an associated network/subnet mask.
the bit number (designated by /) is called  the CIDR(Classless Inter-Domain Routing notation)

Class A : 255.0.0.0(or /8)
Class B : 255.255.0.0(or /16)
Class C : 255.255.255.0(or /24)

Gateway
Destination where n/w traffic goes that has no other matching route or is not intended for the local system network itself

Broadcast Address
Every network has one,operating on the address number 255
Ex: 192.168.1.0/24 network
- 192.168.1.255 is the broadcast address
This is how an IP network sends traffic that can be seen by all hosts on a particular network
